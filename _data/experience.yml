    I served companies in several industries, including railroads, mining, refining, oil & gas (upstream and downstream), electricity production and distribution, banking, retail, and non-profits. My lead role consisted in scoping, building and deploying software solutions (machine learning, mobile apps, data pipelines) and crafting executive communication. For example, a scheduling tool I built saved a logistics company several hundred millions of dollars annually in fuel, crews and equipment. 
    I was also an internal faculty to teach machine learning to other consultants and I led an initiative to connect with academics on topics such as deep learning, reinforcement learning, quantum computing, game theory, and robust optimization.
